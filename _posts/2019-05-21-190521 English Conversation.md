## Script

### English

**A:** Oh, shoot, I only got three. I should've picked up another one. I didn't know you would be here too.

**B:** No, It's OK, I was about leave anyway. Besides, I'm trying to cut down on caffeine thesedays. So you guys go ahead. 

### 한국어

**A:** 아, 이런. 3개 밖에 안사왔는데. 하나 더 사올걸. 너도 있는줄 몰랐어

**B:** 아냐, 괜찮아. 난 어차피 막 갈려고 했어. 게다가 난 요즘 카페인 좀 줄여야 되서. 너네 마셔.
